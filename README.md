# G008

This repository hosts scaffolding for a Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) implementation located in `src/rl_sac`. The current code base provides class and function skeletons that describe the flow of data between replay buffers, policy/value networks, and training routines.

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains sample textual material that mimics the structure of articles used throughout the project. For instance, `examples/sample_article.txt` includes multiple paragraphs that reference SAC concepts such as state representation, policy parameterization, and evaluation workflows. These paragraphs are intended to be processed as independent chunks by downstream tooling.

### Loading the sample article

You can load the example document using standard Python file operations. The snippet below demonstrates how to stream the file and split it into paragraphs for further preprocessing:

```python
from pathlib import Path

example_path = Path("examples/sample_article.txt")
text = example_path.read_text(encoding="utf-8")
paragraphs = [segment.strip() for segment in text.split("\n\n") if segment.strip()]

for idx, paragraph in enumerate(paragraphs, start=1):
    print(f"Paragraph {idx}: {paragraph[:60]}...")
```

This workflow mirrors the intended usage within data ingestion pipelines, ensuring that each section of the article can be independently tokenized or transformed before feeding into SAC-related training tasks.
